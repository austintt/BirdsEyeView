Birdâ€™s Eye View will be a Twitter monitoring tool. The client will be able to enter a search term into the web application, which will then perform several queries on the term. A live feed of tweets containing the term will be displayed. A heat map or chart will display where the concentration of tweets about the term are in the world. A 3rd tool will give a ratio of how many tweets are positive about the subject or negative, as well as displaying examples from each group.
While this application has many potential personal, and journalistic uses, it also has possible value to any person or company interested in tracking reception of brands or events.
